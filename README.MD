## What is PolyProtocol?
PolyProtocol is a lightweight multi-version protocol implementation that only has one dependency!

We are planning on supporting different 36 protocol versions all the way from 1.7.2 and upwards!

## What is it used for?
This library can be used as:
- Packet Translator (ViaVersion style for both Clients and Servers)
- Cross-Compatible Packet Listener (ProtocolLib style but for all platforms not just Bukkit) 
- Packet Wrapper

## Credits
Huge thanks goes to the **[wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg)** team for the amazing protocol documentation
that was used during the development of this library
